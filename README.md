This mod is a custom version of the [Sea Block Pack](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SeaBlockMetaPack). Other than the original mod pack this mod applies some small changes, mostly hiding unnecessary clutter. You can download the mod on the [Factorio Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SeaBlockCustomPack). All changes, including to dependencies, can be found below.

**Please note:** For full experience of this modpack you have to reset your mod settings. As some of them might be hidden, you have to use the red "reset X options to default" button in the top right corner of the mod settings menu. If the button is not available just change any setting temporarily and then click the button. Afterwards you can safely change all visible mod settings to your preferences.
